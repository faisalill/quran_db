Although the Bible recounts the exodus and the drowning of the Pharaoh, it makes no mention of his body having been saved &mdash; nor does the Torah do it. And there is no evidence at all that anyone knew about it when the Qur'aan made this revelation. And except for the believers, no one knew about it as a fact till the nineteenth century when the body was discovered [Watch the YouTube Video].
