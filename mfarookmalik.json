                "M. Farook Malik": "Surely your Lord knows that you stand in prayers nearly two- thirds of the night, and  sometimes one-half or one-third of it, so do others among your companions. Allah  has the measures of the night and the day. He knows that you will not be able to  keep it up, so He has turned to you in Mercy, therefore, read from the Qur\u2019an as  much as you easily can. He knows that there may be some sick people among you,  and some others who travel through the land to seek Allah\u2019s bounty; and yet some  others fighting for the cause of Allah. Therefore, read as much of the Qur\u2019an as you  easily can. Establish the Salah (five time daily prayers) and pay the Zakah (poor  due), and give to Allah a goodly loan. Whatever good you will send forth for  yourselves, you will find it with Allah, which will be much better and greater in reward.  Seek Allah\u2019s forgiveness, surely Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"
