And those who were called upon to witness the transaction and were associated with the event must not refuse when they are called in for evidence in the future. And do not be disinclined to commit the debt, small or large, to writing. Sanctioned by Allah according to judicial principles, this is recourse to a credited testimony preventing doubt.
