If the one who owes is foolish, weak, or unable to dictate himself, let his legal guardian dictate and have it witnessed by two men, or, if there are not two, by one man and two women whom you approve as witnesses. If one of [the women] forgets, the other will remind her. Witnesses should not refuse when they are called upon. Do not think it unimportant to write it down, whether a small or large amount, along with its specified terms. That is more equitable to God, more reliable for testimony, and more likely to preclude doubt, except when it is a current business [that] you manage among yourselves. [In that case], not writing it down is not wrong. Always have witnesses present whenever you trade with one another and do not let any harm be done to either the legal clerk or witnesses. If you do, you will be disobeying God. Be mindful of God, and God will teach you. God knows everything. "
