So recite as became easy, out of Al-Qur\u2018an. He knew that soon there would be among you sick people, and others will travel through the earth, they will seek out of the Bounty of Allah; and (still) others will take part in Qital for the Cause of Allah. So recite as became easy out of it and establish <I>As-Salat</I> and pay-up <I>Zakat</I>, and lend to Allah <I>Qarzan Hasanan</I>. And whatever you send in advance for yourselves in the form of <I>Khair</I> (commendable deeds), you will find it with Allah; it (will be) something extremely good and greater as a reward. And seek Forgiveness from Allah. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"
