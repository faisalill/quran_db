When it is a present trade which you transact between your own selves, then you would not be at fault if you did not write it down. Take witnesses whenever you make a commercial contract, and let no harm be done to the scribe, nor to the witness; but if you do so, this is indeed an act of injustice from your part.

Allah measures the night and the day. He knows perfectly well that you, (\u2018Monotheistic Believers\u2019), will not be able to pray all night, and so He has turned unto you in forgiveness. Recite, then, of the \u2018Qur\u02be\u0101n\u2019 as much as may be easy for you. He knows perfectly well that there will be among you sick, others travelling throughout the land, seeking the Bounty of All\u00e2h; yet others fighting for (serving) the cause of All\u00e2h. Recite, then, of the \u2018Qur\u02be\u0101n\u2019 as much as may be easy for you, establish the regular Prayer, pay Zak\u0101t (i.e. the Prescribed Purifying Alms), and give virtuous loans to All\u00e2h. Whatever good thing you put forward for yourselves, you will find it with All\u00e2h, better and greater in the reward. Thus, seek forgiveness of All\u00e2h.
