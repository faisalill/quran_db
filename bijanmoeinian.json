Therefore, recite as much (of the Qur&rsquo;an) as you can. God is aware that some of you may be sick, some of you may be traveling and some of you striving for the cause of your Lord. Therefore, recite as much as you can; but keep up with your daily prayer and give the least charity tax which is imposed upon you by God. In addition, contribute as much as you can to charity and consider it as a loan to God. Whatever you spend on charity is like being sent a provision for Hereafter kept (and multiplied) for you by God. And beg God for forgiveness as He is the most Forgiving, the most Merciful"
